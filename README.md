# QR Code Generator for LinkedIn URL

This project demonstrates how to generate a QR code from a LinkedIn profile URL using the `pyqrcode` library in Python. The generated QR code is saved as a PNG image that can be scanned to access the LinkedIn profile directly.

## Features

- Generate QR codes from any URL (in this example, a LinkedIn profile URL).
- Save the QR code as a PNG image.
- Easily modify for different use cases by changing the input URL.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pyqrcode` library
- `pypng` library (for saving the QR code as a PNG image)

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the required libraries. Run the following commands to install `pyqrcode` and `pypng`:

```bash
!pip install pyqrcode
!pip install pypng
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the script):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/qr-code-generator.git
   ```

2. **Run the script**:

   Edit the URL string in the script to your desired LinkedIn profile or any URL you want to generate a QR code for. By default, the script generates a QR code for a LinkedIn profile.

   ```python
   import pyqrcode

   # URL or data to encode into a QR code
   a = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/kana-meghana-reddy-220276281/"

   # Generate QR code from the URL
   url = pyqrcode.create(a)

   # Save the generated QR code as a PNG image
   url.png("Linkedin_QR.png", scale=10)
   ```

3. **Output**: The QR code will be saved as `Linkedin_QR.png` in the current directory. You can scan this QR code with any QR code reader to access the URL.

## Customization

- You can modify the `a` variable to encode different URLs, text, or any other data into a QR code.
- The `scale` parameter in the `url.png` method controls the size of the QR code image (higher values generate a larger image).

## Example

If you run the script with the provided LinkedIn URL, it will generate a QR code that, when scanned, takes the user directly to the specified LinkedIn profile.

```bash
python generate_qr_code.py
```

The output will be a PNG image file named `Linkedin_QR.png`.
